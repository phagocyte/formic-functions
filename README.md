<sup>Not actual game footage.</sup>

Each player starts with one ant - a queen, who collects food. Each piece of food can be held or used to produce a worker. Workers also collect food to be brought back to the queen.

All players compete in one arena. The winner is the queen holding the most food after she has taken 30,000 turns. The catch is that the ants can only communicate by changing the colors of the arena squares, which may also be changed by rival ants...

## Leaderboard

After 593 games (over 3 days), there are still some joint places but a unique first place has emerged. These results are based on the players as they were at 18:01 UTC Sunday 11th March 2018. The former Miners on a Rail has been rewritten as Sliding Miners, and is now in first place, but a new tournament is currently running with further player updates, so a new leaderboard will be posted whenever another unique 1st place resolves...

Each game involves a randomly selected 16 players. At the end of each game, a player's score is the number of players whose queen holds less food than theirs. The average score per game is used to determine the leaderboard order. Joint places indicate that the order of players is not yet consistent between 6 subsets of the games played so far. The list of games is split into 6 subsets because this is the minimum number that will give a probability of less than 5% that a given pair of players will be assigned distinct places in the wrong order.
